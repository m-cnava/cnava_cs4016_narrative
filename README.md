# Fuel Efficiency of 2017 Cars - Narrative Visualization

An interactive narrative visualization that explores the relationship between city and highway fuel efficiency for 2017 automobiles, implemented as a martini glass structure using D3.js.

## üöó Overview

This project presents a data-driven story about car fuel efficiency through an interactive scatter plot visualization. The narrative follows a **martini glass structure** where users are guided through the story before being allowed to explore the data freely.

## ‚ú® Features

### **Narrative Structure**
- **4 Progressive Scenes** that build understanding step-by-step
- **Martini Glass Design** - guided storytelling followed by free exploration
- **Scene-specific annotations** that highlight key insights
- **Smooth transitions** between narrative phases

### **Interactive Elements**
- **Hide/Show Controls** for description, legend, and chart annotations
- **Navigation buttons** to move between scenes
- **Fuel type filtering** in the exploration phase
- **Interactive tooltips** with detailed car information
- **Responsive design** with professional styling

### **Data Visualization**
- **Scatter plot** showing City MPG vs Highway MPG
- **Color coding** by fuel type (Gasoline, Diesel, Electric)
- **Size encoding** representing engine cylinders
- **Logarithmic scales** for better data distribution
- **Professional annotations** with connecting lines

## üéØ Narrative Scenes

### **Scene 0: Overview**
- Introduction to the scatter plot and basic patterns
- Highlights the general clustering of cars in the middle efficiency range
- Shows the positive correlation between city and highway MPG

### **Scene 1: Fuel Types**
- Introduces color coding by fuel type
- Demonstrates gasoline dominance in the market
- Shows diesel efficiency advantages

### **Scene 2: Electric Revolution**
- Focuses on electric vehicles as clear outliers
